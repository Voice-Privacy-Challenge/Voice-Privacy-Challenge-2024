```

## Download data

`./01_download_data_model.sh` 
Password required, please register to get the password.  

You can modify the `librispeech_corpus` variable of `./01_download_data_model.sh` to avoid downloading LibriSpeech 360.  
You should modify the `iemocap_corpus` variable of `./01_download_data_model.sh` to where it is located on your server.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The [IEMOCAP](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/iemocap_release.htm) corpus needs to be downloaded on your own by submitting a request at https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/iemocap_release.htm.

## Anonymization and Evaluation
There are 2 options:
1.  (Recommended) Run anonymization and evaluation: `./02_run.sh configs/anon_mcadams.yaml`.  
    The available configs are:
    - [configs/anon_mcadams.yaml](configs/anon_mcadams.yaml) (the default) a fast CPU only signal processing based system. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01130)
    - [configs/anon_template.yaml](configs/anon_template.yaml) a template here to guide you through creating your own system.
    - [configs/anon_sttts.yaml](configs/anon_sttts.yaml) a system based on (unmodified) phone sequence, (modified) prosody, and (modified) speaker embedding representations + TTS. [paper1](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2022/meyer22b_interspeech.html), [paper2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10022601), [paper3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096607)
    - [configs/anon_nac.yaml](configs/anon_nac.yaml) a system based on **n**eural **a**udio **c**odecs. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14129)
    - [configs/anon_asrbn.yaml](configs/anon_asrbn.yaml) a system based on vector quantized acoustic bottleneck, pitch, and one-hot speaker representations + HiFi-GAN. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04455)
2.  Run separately anonymization and evaluation in the two steps detailed here:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 1: Anonymization
```
python run_anonymization.py --config configs/anon_mcadams.yaml
```
The anonymized directories (kaldi-like structure) will be saved in `$data_dir=data` (see configs/anon_mcadams.yaml) for the 9 necessary folders.  
The names of the created anonymized dataset are appended with the suffix of the anonymization pipeline, i.e. `$anon_data_suffix=_mcadams` (see configs/anon_mcadams.yaml).  
For McAdams, anonymization of all data may vary from 30 min up to 10 hours depending on the available the number of available CPU cores.

After anonymization, the directories produced are the following:
```log
data_dir=data
anon_data_suffix=_mcadams
${data_dir}/libri_dev_enrolls${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
${data_dir}/libri_dev_trials_m${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
${data_dir}/libri_dev_trials_f${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav

${data_dir}/libri_test_enrolls${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
${data_dir}/libri_test_trials_m${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
${data_dir}/libri_test_trials_f${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav

${data_dir}/IEMOCAP_dev${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
${data_dir}/IEMOCAP_test${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav

${data_dir}/train-clean-360${anon_data_suffix}/wav/*wav
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When developing your own anonymization system, you can simply replicate this directory/wav
> structure.  
> The evaluation script will take care of everything else.  
>
> Or for more detailed example of an anonymization system, with wav.scp loading and
> directory structure creation, please refer to:
> - [configs/anon_template.yaml](./configs/anon_template.yaml)
> - [anonymization/modules/template/anonymise_dir.py](./anonymization/modules/template/anonymise_dir.py)
> - [anonymization/pipelines/template/template_pipeline.py](./anonymization/pipelines/template/template_pipeline.py)

#### Step 2: Evaluation
Evaluation metrics includes:
- Privacy: Equal error rate (EER) for ignorant, lazy-informed, and semi-informed attackers (only results from the semi-informed attacker will be used in the challenge ranking) 
- Utility:
  - Word Error Rate (WER) by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model (trained on LibriSpeech)
  - Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) by a speech emotion recognition (SER) model (trained on IEMOCAP).



To run evaluation for a pipeline you need to:
1. Have prepare the above anonymized data directories.
2. modify entry in [configs/eval_pre.yaml](./configs/eval_post.yaml)
   and [configs/eval_post.yaml](./configs/eval_post.yaml) if you are not using [02_run.sh](./02_run.sh):
    ```yaml
    anon_data_suffix: !PLACEHOLDER  # suffix for the anonymized dataset, e.g. _mcadams, _sttts, ...
    ```
3. perform evaluations
    ```sh
    python run_evaluation.py --config configs/eval_pre.yaml
    python run_evaluation.py --config configs/eval_pre.yaml
    ```

4. get the final relevant results for ranking
    ```sh
    anon_suffix=$anon_data_suffix  # TODO # suffix for the anonymized dataset, e.g. _mcadams, _sttts
    results_summary_path_orig=exp/results_summary/eval_orig${anon_suffix}/results_orig.txt # the same value as $results_summary_path in configs/eval_pre.yaml
    results_summary_path_anon=exp/results_summary/eval_anon${anon_suffix}/results_anon.txt # the same value as $results_summary_path in configs/eval_post.yaml
    results_exp=exp/results_summary
    { cat "${results_summary_path_orig}"; echo; cat "${results_summary_path_anon}"; } > "${results_exp}/result_for_rank${anon_suffix}"
    ```

> (All of the four above step are automated in [02_run.sh](./02_run.sh)).

## Results

The result file with all the metrics and all datasets for submission will be generated in:
* Summary results: `./exp/results_summary/result_for_rank$anon_data_suffix`

Please see the [RESULTS folder](./results) for the provided anonymization pipelines.

### Some potential questions you may have and how to solve:
> 1. $ASV_{eval}^{anon}$ training is slow

Training of the $ASV_{eval}^{anon}$ model may vary from about 2 up to 10 hours depending on the available hardware.
If you have an SSD or a high-performance drive, $ASV_{eval}^{anon}$ takes ~2h, but if the drive is old and slow, in a worse case,  $ASV_{eval}^{anon}$ training takes ~10h. Increasing $num_workers in config/eval_post.yaml may help to speed up the processing.

> 2. OOM problem when decoding by $ASR_{eval}$

Reduce the $eval_bachsize in config/eval_pre.yaml

> 3. The $ASR_{eval}$ is a [pretrained wav2vec+ctc trained on LibriSpeech-960h](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-wav2vec2-librispeech)
